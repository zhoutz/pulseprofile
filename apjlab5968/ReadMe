Description of contents: The tar.gz file provided includes output in ascii 
 format from one of the codes used in the comparison tests shown in Figures 3 
 through 13. These files are being provided to the community to facilitate 
 testing of other independently developed ray-tracing codes. 

System requirements: None.

Additional comments: There are 24 files. A brief description of each type is
 given below.

 There are 6 files labeled "SD1*_test_IM.txt" where "*" goes from "a" to "f".
 These are two column tables that show the rotational pulse phase (column #1) 
 and the photon flux (column #2) in units of photons/cm^2/s/keV See Table 1 for 
 the parameter values of these code runs.

 There are 4 files labeled "SD2*_test_GSFCS.txt" where "*" goes from "a" to "d".
 These have 3 columns and list the rotational pulse phase (column #1), the 
 photon energy in keV as measured by the observer (column #2), and the 
 monochromatic photon flux (column #3) at that combination of pulse phase and 
 photon energy in units of photons/cm^2/s/keV. Table 2 gives the parameter 
 values for the 4 models used to produce these results.

 There are 10 files labeled "OS1*_test_IM.txt" where "*" goes from "a" to "j".
 These are two column tables that list the rotational pulse phase (column #1) 
 and the monochromatic photon flux (column #2) at 1 keV in units of 
 photons/cm^2/s/keV. Table 3 and 4 list the model parameters used to produce 
 these synthetic pulse profiles.

 Two additional files "OS1k_test_GSFCS.txt" and "OS1l_test_GSFCS.txt" have
 three columns and give the rotational pulse phase (column #1), the photon 
 energy in keV as measured by the observer (column #2),  and the monochromatic 
 photon flux (column #3) at that combination of pulse phase and photon energy 
 in units of photons/cm^2/s/keV. The last two columns of Table 4 provides the 
 parameters used to produce the output contained in these files.

 The file "deflection_angle_lensing_factor_test_CU.txt" is a three column table
 of the calculated light ray deflection angle (\psi) and "lensing factor" 
 (d\cos\alpha/d\cos\psi) shown in Figure 3. The first column in the file gives
 the deflection angle (\psi), the second column gives the angle between the 
 radial direction and the initial direction of the light ray (\alpha), and the 
 third column gives the value of the lensing factor (d\cos\alpha/d\cos\psi).

 Finally, the file "travel_time_delay_test_CU.txt" is another three column
 table that provides one output of the calculation of the the travel time delay 
 integral from Equation (18) that is shown in Figure 4. The first column in 
 the file gives the deflection angle (\psi), the second column gives the angle 
 between the radial direction and the initial direction of the light ray 
 (\alpha), and the third column gives the travel time delay in seconds 
 relative to a radial ray.
